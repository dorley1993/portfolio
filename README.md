# My Portfolio

## Description 
---
This is my portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase some of my new skill as a web developer. The first thing I did was research. What did I want it to look like? Looking through my guidelines and multiple other websites, I decided I knew what I wanted it to look like. I sketched out the basic outline and functions on a piece of paper. Then I got to work.

    1. I created the index.html
    2. I did some research on bootstrap navbars and found one I liked. That is when I created the navbar.
    3. I put together the main page first. I used media queries(for a responsive layout), after setting my columns and rows. I chose to have a main area then when you scroll down it is a paragraph about me, below that is skills, then my featured projects. 
    4. Designed the footer. I wanted my social links, email, and name on the footer. I used bootstrap icons for this and font awesome. Then linked them to my pages.
    5. Then I got my form to work.
    6. After I worked on my javaScript file, creating the skills area, projects area, and contact area. 

    I learned:
        * How to create the typewriter effect in javascript

        
    I further understood:
        * local storage
        * creating elements with jquery
        * creating zip files for download
        * contact forms
