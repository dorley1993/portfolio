# My Portfolio

## Description 
---
This is my portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase some of my new skill as a web developer. The first thing I did was research. What did I want it to look like? Looking through my guidelines and multiple other websites, I decided I knew what I wanted it to look like. I sketched out the basic outline and functions on a piece of paper. Then I got to work.

    1. I created the index.html
    2. I did some research on bootstrap navbars and found one I liked. That is when I created the navbar.
    3. I put together the main page first. I used media queries(for a responsive layout), after setting my columns and rows. I chose to have a main area then when you scroll down it is a paragraph about me, below that is skills, then my featured projects. 
    4. Designed the footer. I wanted my social links, email, and name on the footer. I used bootstrap icons for this and font awesome. Then linked them to my pages.
    5. Then I got my form to work.
    6. After I worked on my javaScript file, creating the skills area, projects area, and contact area. 

    I learned:
        * How to create the typewriter effect in javascript

        
    I further understood:
        * local storage
        * creating elements with jquery
        * creating zip files for download

To download my resume, click on the resume button at the top.


You might notice that I created a typewriter effect for "Hi, I am Danielle", using javaScript. Introducing me. Below that is my picture. 


As you scroll down, you will come across a paragraph about me, then a list of the skills I've learned. 

Scroll down more, to view my feature projects. These are the last three projects worked on. You can click the name underneath the image, this is a hyperlink for the website. The github icon, is a link to the repository for the project. 

Below the projects, is a more projects button. This clears the main area and presents the projects page. If you would like to go to the main area again, just click home. 

On the footer, you will see my email and social links. The github, indeed, instagram, and a email icon. The email icon will bring you to my contact page. Where you can fill the information out. Once you submit this form, it saves the information directly to the local storage.
